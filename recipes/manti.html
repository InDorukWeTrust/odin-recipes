                <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
            </ul>

        <li><h4>Yogurt Sauce</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 container plain yogurt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4><p>Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands.
         Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</p></li>
         <li><h4>Step 2</h4><p>Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. 
            Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4><p>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 4</h4><p>Divide dough in half.
             Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.</p></li>
             <li><h4>Step 5</h4><p>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. 
                Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Step 6</h4><p>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Step 7</h4><p>Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside</p></li>
            <li><h4>Step 8</h4><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Step 9</h4><p>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.</p></li>
    </ol>
